# Millie Burst

## üé® Description

A high-performance 3D particle explosion effect that creates an immersive burst animation using instanced geometry and custom GLSL shaders. The animation features dynamic bloom effects, smooth transitions, and interactive controls.

- **Functionality:** Creates an explosive particle burst effect with thousands of individual 3D particles that respond to user interaction
- **Utility:** Perfect for interactive web experiences, loading animations, or transition effects that require high-performance particle systems
- **Rationale:** Provides a unique combination of performance and visual quality by using GPU-accelerated instanced rendering and post-processing effects

## üîç Overview

- **Technology Stack:**
  - Three.js for 3D rendering
  - Custom GLSL shaders for particle animation
  - Post-processing pipeline with Bloom and Vignette effects
  - Instance-based rendering for optimal performance
  
- **Complexity Level:** Advanced
  - Requires understanding of WebGL and GLSL
  - Knowledge of 3D mathematics and quaternions
  - Familiarity with post-processing techniques

- **Animation Features:**
  - Interactive particle explosion effect
  - Dynamic bloom post-processing
  - Smooth particle movement using quaternion rotation
  - Responsive design that adapts to window size
  - Optimized performance using instanced rendering

- **Requirements:**
  - Modern browser with WebGL support
  - GPU with shader support
  - Minimum screen resolution: 1024x768
